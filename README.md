# Authenticating the signature using MD5 hash algorithm

This repository demonstrates message authentication using the HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) technique with the MD5 hash algorithm.

It verifies the authenticity and integrity of a message shared between a sender and a receiver using a shared secret key.

The program simulates both sender and receiver sides and also includes a tampering test to show how signature verification fails if the message is altered.
